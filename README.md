# MIT Futuremakers Applied Deep Learning

Day 1 (July 6th, 2021) 
------------ 
I hope to learn valuable knowledge about AI and seeing my progress in Deep Learning grow. As part of the program, I look forward to developing my knowledge about machine learning and AI and applying it to develop a project for the Create-A-Thon.

Day 2 (July 7th, 2021)
--------------
At Dr. Kong's leadership development seminar today, I learned about taking action in to make a postitive impact in my community. I was able to develop my story and listen to other's inspirational stories as well. This seminar motivated me to create change against as an advocative and visionary leader. 

Day 3 (July 8th, 2021)
----------------
1. Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled data and the model predicts an outcome. In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled and the model finds patterns. 
2. Scikit-learn is used for machine learning calculations and modelling. Therfore, other libraries must be used when loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising the data.  

Day 4 (July 9th, 2021)
---------------
Social media is becoming increasingly common in today's digital world. However, along with the positive benefis, social media has drawbacks as well including its affect on anxiety levels. Using a dataset with anxiety levels, I can predict anxiety levels among differnt age groups. 
Here is the link to my dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/stress-analysis-in-social-media
By predicting levels of anxiety, a potential solution can be found to help. I would use regression because it will allow me to find which variables have impact on anxiety (age, social media usage, etc.) 

Day 7 (July 12th, 2021)
------------
1. Tensors are multidimensional arrays and they are mathematical objects in data. Tensors are important in machine learning because they are a type of data structure and help encode the data.  
2. Tensors involved calculations and splitting the dataset into train and test sets. Weights, biases, and lambdas were encoded and the multidimensional arrays are part of linear algebra.

Day 8 (July 13th, 2021)
------------
I learned about Neural Networks and its bulding blocks and how it relates to the human brain. An activation function determines whether or not a neuron should be activated by calculating the weighted sum and adding bias. In perceptron functionality, an artificial neural network will take inputs and multiply them with the weights. Then, the resulting multiplied vlalues will be added as the weighted sum. Lastly, the weighted sum will applied to the proper activation function. ANNs also have various dimensions based on the amount of hidden layers and connection patterns. The backpropagation algorithm propagates backwards by finding the derivative of error with respect to the corresponding weight and  subtracting the value from the weight value to minimize the error. In forward-feedback, the model propagates forward to get the output and compares it with the real value to get the error estimate.

Day 9 (July 14th, 2021)
-----------
I learned about convolutional neural networks and how its used for images since each image is amatrix of pixel values. A kernel is a matrix of weights. Once the feature maprs are extracted, they are moved to an activation layer, more specifically ReLU. The pooling operation reduces the size of the feature map by taking the maximum value in a block. 

Day 10 (July 15th, 2021)
-------------
I learned about the types of biases and considerations for a non-biased algorithm. AI can be biased; AI bias is the  prejudice in data. I also learned about the causes of bias. 
1. Machine Learning played an important role in the hiring process of the startup by making it much quicker and efficent prcoess. In the development and design of this game, machine learning utilized the player's actions to be used as the train data. By using this data, the algorithm is trained to have the human player's thinking process when predicting. 
2. An example of a biased machine learning model includes Amazon's hiring process in 2015. Amazon's hiring process algorithm was biased against women. This was because resumes submitted over the prior ten years primarily included men applicants. Therefore, the AI was trained to favor men over women. To make this model more fair and inclusive, the false positive rates must be consistent when comparing the genders. 
I chose this specific biased model because Amazon is a huge global tech-reliant company and if they are involved in discrimination then they are undermining equal oppurtunity around the world. 

Day 11 (July 16th, 2021)
----------
A convolutional neural network is more specialized efficient when compared to a fully connected neural network. In a fully connected layer, each neuron is connected to the neurons in each layer. Additionally, in a fully connected layer each connection has it's own particular weight and the model makes no assumptions about the features in the data. On the other hand, in a convolutional neural network, the neurons are connected with surrounding neurons. All neurons consist of the same weight. In neural networks, For Convolutional Neural network architecture, there are 3 convolutional layers with an activation function, such as as reLU, and a max pool layer after the first convolutional layer.
