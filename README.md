# MIT Futuremakers Applied Deep Learning

Day 1 (July 6th, 2021) 

I hope to learn valuable knowledge about AI and seeing my progress in Deep Learning grow. As part of the program, I look forward to developing my knowledge about machine learning and AI and applying it to develop a project for the Create-A-Thon.

Day 2 (July 7th, 2021)

At Dr. Kong's leadership development seminar today, I learned about taking action in to make a postitive impact in my community. I was able to develop my story and listen to other's inspirational stories as well. This seminar motivated me to create change against as an advocative and visionary leader. 

Day 3 (July 8th, 2021)

1. Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled data and the model predicts an outcome. In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled and the model finds patterns. 
2. Scikit-learn is used for machine learning calculations and modelling. Therfore, other libraries must be used when loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising the data.  

Day 4 (July 9th, 2021)

Social media is becoming increasingly common in today's digital world. However, along with the positive benefis, social media has drawbacks as well including its affect on anxiety levels. Using a dataset with anxiety levels, I can predict anxiety levels among differnt age groups. 
Here is the link to my dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/stress-analysis-in-social-media
By predicting levels of anxiety, a potential solution can be found to help. I would use regression because it will allow me to find which variables have impact on anxiety (age, social media usage, etc.)
